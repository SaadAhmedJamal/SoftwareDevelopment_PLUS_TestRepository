## Dealing with Python Environment

# Created a Python environment myenvThree
Installed python library plotly in the newly created environment.

# Exported the file using command
For requirements file in txt format:
``` conda env export > myThree.txt ```
For exporting the python environment yml file:
``` conda env export > myThree.yml into yml file ```

The commands were taken from the [@Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48278769/export-import-conda-environment-and-package-including-local-files)

# Commitited a conda environment using GitHUB Online myenvThree


# Forked the repo of someone in the course 
Under the repositories tab forked repo's can be seen.

# recreated the environment softdevenv

``` conda env create -f softdevenv.yml ```
The environment can be forked from the repository [pochsarah/PLUS_softwaredev_2022](https://github.com/pochsarah/PLUS_softwaredev_2022)

_ Modify the environment (i.e. install one or more new packages like
GDAL if it isnâ€˜t already included!)

# Update the requirements file (i.e. export the modified environment)
using the export command exported the requirements file

# Add, commit and push the new requirements file
Used GITHUB online

# Create a pull request (and accept, reject or comment on the request from someone else!)
Created a pull request to the repositories [pochsarah/PLUS_softwaredev_2022](https://github.com/pochsarah/PLUS_softwaredev_2022)

#Diffuculties:
The problem arised in recreating the environment due to dependencies.
In the python environment file, seperate out the dependencies that are highlighted in command line prompt 
and use ``` pip: ``` before it. This lets the compiler know that these dependecies can be installed later.
